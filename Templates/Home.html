                    The users in the lobby will be randomly assorted which will be used to determine the order in which they go. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user that goes first will be prompted 3 different things to draw which they can choose from. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once chosen, the word will show up on their screen and no one else and their camera will be displayed on the page for everyone to see, this is where they can begin to draw using their hands and a timer will begin. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the other players, they must guess which will be possible with a chat in which they will type out the word they believe is being drawn. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If it is guessed correctly, the user that guessed it first will be awarded the most points which will be determined by the amount of time it took, the others however will still be able to guess due to the correct word being hidden upon being entered, they will be awarded points the same way if they guess it correctly or the time will run out and the word will be revealed to them as well as everyone's current score. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, the game will continue as it started with everyone taking turns drawing and guessing for a series of rounds with the winner being shown at the end.
